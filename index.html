                  <p>I have been cooking since I can remember. Through my grandparent’s love for cooking, I’ve been in the kitchen most days helping them out. I used this time to bond with my grandparents over cooking, so it has always been one of my biggest passions and hobbies. Over the last 2 years, after watching countless YouTube cooking videos, and TV shows, my passion for cooking grew to an all time high. Finding out about the links between culture, geography, history, and of course food has been very interesting to me. Even though I have cooked some meals, I have never been the one deciding what to eat for dinner, and how the specific food should be cooked. Ever since I was a small kid, I always wanted to see this mini-goal come to life, and by doing this project, this goal can be fulfilled. For these reasons, I knew that the Personal Project would be an ideal opportunity to learn more about cooking techniques and what skills are required to master it. Therefore I decided that my learning goal would be to improve my cooking techniques, as well as developing my time management skills, and creative thinking skills.</p>

        <h2 id="Meal1">Meal 1</h2>
        <h3>Biryani rice, Palak Paneer, Chicken Curry</h3>
        <img src="Pictures/Meal 1.png">
        <p>Time Taken: 3 Hours</p>
        <p>Techniques: Finely Chopping Vegetables, Thickening Sauce, Sautéing</p>
<p>Rating: The rice was the best dish, I would rate it 8/10, it had the perfect texture, but lacked some of the indian herbs that I could not find. 
  The Palak Paneer was a 7/10, it lacked flavor, also due to the lack of indian ingredients, but again, the texture was near perfect. 
  I found that the chicken curry had great flavour, but was too watery, so I would rate it a 6/10.
  My family really enjoyed the dinner, similar to me, they also enjoyed the biryani rice the most, but their overall ratings were much closer than mine. Overall, they rated the rice a 8.5/10, the palak paneer a 7.6 out of 10, and they rated the curry an 7.5/10.
  Something that I did well while cooking this meal is that I was very organised </p>
<p>Improvment:Something I can improve on is that I could improve my knife skills, as I found that it took me a longer time to cut the many onions and tomatoes needed in this recipe. 
I will be practicing chopping techniques, as this will help me be more time efficient and organized while cooking. I will be watching youtube tutorials on cutting, and ask some experienced chefs on how to improve. </p>
<p>Overall: I would like to give this meal a 7.8/10 rating, as most of the rating that were given by my family and myself were around the 7.5-8 range. Therefore, the final rating is a 7.8/10.
</p>
  
        <h2 id="Meal2">Meal 2</h2>
        <h3>Risotto with Marinated Chicken</h3>
        <img src="Pictures/Meal 2.png">
        <p>Time Taken: 1.5 Hours</p>
        <p>Techniques: Finely Chopped Vegetables, Thickening Sauce, Sautéing, Marination, Evaporating Wine</p>
<p>Rating: I think that this meal went really well, the risotto has the perfect texture, and the right amount of flavour from the mushrooms and the cheese. The only suggestion I would have is for the onions to be cooked a bit more, as a couple of onions were slightly crunchy. Therefore I will rate it a 9/10. As of the marinated chicken, the flavour was ideal, and the chicken was tender. The only problem is that the chicken did not really go well with the risotto, so I have to rate it a 9/10.
  The others who ate this meal (my family), thought that the texture of the risotto was very good, and the perfect taste, but thought that the chicken and the risotto did not go well together, making them eat it separately. The rated the risotto a 9/10, and the chicken a 8.5/10.
  This time, after watching youtube tutorials, I cut the onions and mushrooms needed for this dish much quicker then when I cooked the Indian meal. This made the cooking time of my meal faster then expected, and also made the kitchen much neater during the cooking process.</p>
<p>Improvment: should make sure that the 2 dishes combine well together, as in this case, it did not. </p>
<p>Overall: The rating I would give this dish is a 8.8/10, as most of the ratings given were 9/10s, but one was lower at 8.5, so the rating averages out to around 8.8/10.</p>
    
        <h2 id="Meal3">Meal 3</h2>
        <h3>Pork Chop with Ratatouille</h3>
        <img src="Pictures/Meal 3.png">
        <p>Time Taken: 2 Hours</p>
        <p>Techniques: Finely Chopped Vegetables, Thickening Sauce, Sautéing, Frying</p>
<p>Rating: I think that this meal went really well, the ratatouille had great texture, and the right flavour from the tomato and eggplant. The only suggestion I would have is for there to be a slightly larger amount of seasoning, as it was not salty enough for my liking. Therefore I will rate it a 8.5/10. As of the pork chop, the flavour was ideal, and the gravy went really well with the pork. The only problem is that some parts of the pork was tough to chew, therefore I have to rate it a 8/10.
  My family thought that the gravy was the perfect thickness, and the perfect match for the porkchop. Their only complaint was that the pork was not as tender as they would have liked, so they rated it a 7.5/10. But for the ratatouille, they thought that it was amazing, and did not have any suggestions for it. They rated it a 10/10.</p>
<p>Improvment: I could improve on cooking the pork chops, in order to make the meat more tender, not only this, but I could use a tendorising hammer before cooking the meat to make it easier to chew.  </p>
<p>Overall: I would rate this meal a 8.8/10, as my family really liked the ratatouille, pulling the overall rating up.</p>
    

        <h2 id="Meal4">Meal 4</h2>
        <h3>Chicken Saltimbocca, Chicken Wings</h3>
        <img src="Pictures/Meal 4.png">
        <p>Time Taken: 3 Hours</p>
        <p>Techniques: Pan Frying, Assembling with Toothpicks, Deep Frying</p>
<p>Rating: I think that this meal went really well, the saltimbocca had great texture, and the right flavour. Personally, I don’t have any suggestions as of how this dish could be improved. Therefore I will rate it a 10/10. As of the chicken wings, the flavour was ideal, and the wings were crunchy. The only problem is that some parts were not as crunchy as the others, as the wings were stuck together while getting fried, so I rated it a 9/10.
  My family and friends thought that the saltimbocca was very good, as they really liked the flavour of the parma ham on top of it. They rated it a 9.6/10. Their only complaint of the meal once again, some parts of the chicken wings were not as crunchy as wanted, so they rated it a 9/10. </p>
<p>Improvment: I would fry the chicken wings in a larger pot, as the only down side of the meal was that some part of the wings were not crunchy enough. 
  Next time, I will make sure that I am using the correct size cooking utensil to cook the food, avoiding any unwanted side affects.</p>
<p>Overall: I would rate this meal a 9.5/10, as my friends and family really liked the saltimbocca, and generally liked the chicken wings. </p>

        <h2 id="Meal5">Meal 5</h2>
        <h3>Rösti with St. Galler Sausage and Fried Egg</h3>
        <img src="Pictures/Meal 5.png">
        <p>Time Taken: 45 Minutes</p>
        <p>Techniques: Pan Frying, Preparing sausages, flipping out of a pan</p>
<p>Rating: I think that this meal went really well, the rösti had great texture, and the right flavour. Personally, I don’t have any suggestions as of how this dish could be improved. Therefore I will rate it a 10/10. As of the sausages, the flavour was ideal, and the sausage was cooked to the ideal color. The only problem is some parts were cooked more thoroughly than others, making the falvour alter at different parts of the sausage. The egg was cooked perfectly, it si a simple egg, with a good amount of seasoning. Overall, I would rate this dish a 9.5/10
  My family and friends thought that the rösti was very good, as they really liked the flavour of the egg mixed with the rösti while eating it. They rated it a 9.5/10. Their only complaint of the meal once again, some parts of sausage tasted more cooked than other parts.</p>
<p>Improvment: I would flip the sausage over more times, making sure that the whole sausage is cooked evenly. Not only that, but I will also need to learn how to flip something on a pan, as that is a key technique needed to cook this meal.</p>
<p>Overall: I would rate this meal a 9.6/10, as my family really liked the meal in generall, and could not think of much else to improve on apart from the sausages. </p>

        
        <h2 id="Meal6">Meal 6</h2>
        <h3>Spätzle with Buttered Asparagus</h3>
        <img src="Pictures/Meal 6.png">
        <p>Time Taken: 1.5 Hours</p>
        <p>Techniques: Butter basting, preparing food for oven</p>
<p>Rating: I think that this meal went really well, the spätzli had great texture, and the ideal flavour. I don’t have any suggestions as of how this dish could be improved. Therefore I will rate it a 10/10. As of the asperagus, the flavour was ideal, and the asperagus was cooked to the ideal terxture. One problem is that it was only the asparagus, with not onion or any other sort of food, making it a bit boring, I would rate it a 8/10. 
  My family and friends thought that the spätzli was very good, as they really liked the flavour of the cheese mixed with the bacon while eating it. They rated it a 9.5/10. Their only complaint was that the dish was too oily for their liking due to the chese. </p>  
<p>Improvment: I would cook the asparagus with more things, for example onion or garlic, as the dish only consisted of asparagus. Next time, I would think if a dish needs anything else to make it interesting for the eater.</p>
<p>Overall: I would rate this meal a 9/10, as my family really liked the meal in generall, as it reminded them of home, and the falvour mixed really well together.</p>
